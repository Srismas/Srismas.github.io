                        <p>We believe in the Bible as the verbally (every word) and plenary (completely) inspired Word of God. The Bible is without error and contradiction.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the Godhead eternally exists in three Persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit; and that these three are one God.</p>
                        <p>We believe in the deity and virign birth of our Lord Jesus Chris. Jesus died, was buried, and rose again the third day for our sins.</p>
                        <p>We believe that a person is saved when they repent and exercise faith by accepting Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. the believer is kept by the power of God and is eternally secure in Christ.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the local church is composed of baptized believers who have joined together voluntarily. Every local church ought to be autonomous and self-governing; therefore, we recognize no ecclesiastical organization as having authority over Tri-City Baptist Church.</p>
                        <p>We practice the two ordinances of baptism by immersion and the Lord's supper as regular functions of the local church.</p>
                        <p>We believe in the "Blessed Hope," which is the personal, bodily, pre-tribulation, pre-millennial, and imminent return of our Lord and Savior for His chruch.</p>
                        <p> We believe Christians are to be personally separated from all worldly practices that hinder spiritual growth and stability. TCBC will be separated from all forms of apostasy and religious inclusiveness.</p>
                        <p>We believe that by the power of the Holy Spirit, we all as members of this church should walk together in Christian love, strive for the advancement of this church in knowledge, holiness, and godliness.</p>
